# Enhanced Phishing Detection Debug Guide

## Current Status: ‚úÖ WORKING!

Your extension **is** detecting phishing indicators correctly! The log output shows:

```
üö® PHISHING INDICATOR DETECTED: phi_003 - Common Microsoft 365 phishing keywords
üö® PHISHING INDICATOR DETECTED: phi_015_code_obfuscation - Page contains obfuscated JavaScript code
Phishing indicators check: 2 threats found, score: 19
üö® PHISHING INDICATORS FOUND on non-Microsoft page: 2 threats
‚ö†Ô∏è SUSPICIOUS CONTENT: Showing warning for phishing indicators
```

## Enhancements Made

### 1. **Upgraded Detection Rules**
- **phi_003**: Upgraded from "medium/warn" to "high/block" with expanded patterns
- **phi_015**: Upgraded from "high" to "critical" with higher confidence (0.90)
- **Added new indicators**:
  - `phi_016_suspicious_url_structure`: Detects long encoded URL parameters
  - `phi_017_microsoft_brand_abuse`: Microsoft branding + login terms on wrong domain
  - `phi_018_credential_form_non_microsoft`: Credential forms on non-Microsoft domains

### 2. **Enhanced Patterns**
- **phi_003** now catches: "verify account", "suspended 365", "update office", "secure microsoft", "account security", "security verification", "login microsoft", "microsoft login", "microsoft authentication", etc.

### 3. **Browser Console Functions**
You can now call these functions from the browser console for debugging:

#### **analyzeCurrentPage()**
```javascript
analyzeCurrentPage()
```
Provides comprehensive analysis including:
- Detection rules status
- URL/domain analysis
- Trusted domain check
- M365 login detection
- Phishing indicators analysis
- Blocking rules check
- Forms analysis
- Content pattern analysis

#### **testPhishingIndicators()**
```javascript
testPhishingIndicators()
```
Tests all phishing indicators against current page with detailed match information.

## Why You're Seeing "2 threats" Instead of Blocking

The page detected:
1. **phi_003** (Microsoft 365 phishing keywords) - Now set to "block"
2. **phi_015** (code obfuscation) - Now set to "critical/block"

With the upgrades, this should now trigger blocking instead of just warnings.

## Testing Instructions

1. **Refresh the phishing page** to get the new detection rules
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Run analysis**: Type `analyzeCurrentPage()` and press Enter
4. **Check detailed results** for all detection categories

## Expected Behavior Now

- **phi_003** + **phi_015** = Both set to "block"
- **Combined critical threats** should trigger immediate blocking
- **Enhanced patterns** should catch more obvious phishing attempts

The detection is working - the enhancements should now provide more aggressive blocking for obvious phishing pages!
